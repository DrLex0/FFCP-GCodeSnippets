### MAKE_FCP_X3G CONFIGURATION FILE ###

# Either put this file in the same location as the make_fcp_x3g.pl script
#   and ensure it is called "make_fcp_x3g.txt",
# or pass this file's path to the script with the '-f' parameter.
# (If you are using a symlink to the .pl script, then the script will use that
#   symlink's directory for the default config location.)
#
# Modify the values below according to your environment and preferences.
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.
# Remove the '#' before a line to enable it, add one to disable it.
#
# The format of a valid configuration item is very simple:
#   ITEM_NAME = a value or an array of values.
#
# You can always specify an array, but items marked as [SINGLE] will only
#   consider the first element if you would pass an array. Items that will
#   consider multiple elements are marked as [ARRAY].
# If you need more than a single element in an [ARRAY] value, you must put
#   EACH element between double quotes. For a [SINGLE] value or an [ARRAY]
#   with only 1 element, you can omit the quotes. Some examples:
# EXAMPLE_ARRAY1 = "first element" "second element"
# EXAMPLE_ARRAY2 = this array has only 1 element because no quotes
# EXAMPLE_VALUE1 = "you could enclose a SINGLE in quotes"
# EXAMPLE_VALUE2 = or just omit them
#
# Any whitespace around '=', as well as at the end of the line, is ignored.
# There are no escape characters, everything is literal. This means you cannot
#   really use a double quote anywhere, except to delineate values. None of
#   the values should ever need to contain a double quote.
#
# Avoid non-ASCII characters. If you cannot avoid them, try saving this file
#   in the same codepage as your operating system uses for file paths. Often
#   this will be UTF-8, but it may be different. You're on your own here.


### GLOBAL CONFIGURATION ###

# [SINGLE] Set this to 1 to always keep a backup of the unprocessed G-code
#   file, regardless of -k option (useful for debugging).

KEEP_ORIG = 0

# [SINGLE] Set this to 1 to force debug mode (regardless of -d option).
#   This is useful to debug problems when invoking make_fcp_x3g.pl from within
#   PrusaSlicer or other programs, and not all post-processing steps seem to
#   be working.

DEBUG = 0

# [SINGLE] Optional extra execution path elements.
#   If you want to augment the very basic execution PATH inside PrusaSlicer's
#   post-processing environment, you can add extra path components here.
# In UNIX-like environments: separate components by colons ':'.
# In Windows cmd.exe: separate components by semicolons ';'.
# You can simply leave this empty and use full absolute paths everywhere.
#   The advantage of correctly setting this, is that you can use the plain
#   names of executables (like perl or python3) instead of their full paths.

#EXTRA_PATH = /usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin


### OPTIONAL POST-PROCESSING STEPS ###

# Enable what you want or need. Leave the rest commented out.
#
# RULES:
# * Do not use relative paths.
# * All paths are CASE SENSITIVE regardless of how your OS treats case
#   sensitivity. "Perl" is not the same as "perl".
# * No path can contain a double quote, even if your OS allows it.
# * Do not try to override the -o option in extra post-processing scripts.
# * The best way to disable something is to put a '#' before it to comment out
#   its line. An empty value is also OK.
# * Incorrect paths or non-executable script files will be silently ignored at
#   runtime. They will only be reported when running the script with the
#   sanity check (-c) option. Do this after saving this config, to ensure you
#   did not make any mistakes.
# HINT:
# Avoid manually typing paths! Pretty much every OS has a way of directly
#   obtaining a file's path. For instance in Windows: right-click the file
#   while holding down shift and use "Copy as path".

# [SINGLE] Path to the gpx binary that converts gcode to printable files.
#   If the binary can be found in (EXTRA_)PATH, just 'gpx' suffices.
#   Otherwise, specify the full path (you might be able to obtain it with
#   `which gpx` in UNIX-like systems, or `where gpx` in Windows).
# To disable conversion to X3G (and leave it up to e.g. OctoPrint), comment
#   out the line or set an empty value.

#GPX = /usr/local/bin/gpx

# The following are all Perl or Python scripts and are all [ARRAY] type values
#   such that a command with multiple arguments can be provided.
#   You can specify these as follows.
# 1. If perl or python is not in PATH, or you are unsure:
#    "/path/to/perl" "/path/to/script.pl"
#      or:
#    "C:\Strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe" "C:\path\to\script.pl"
# 2. If perl/python is in PATH:
#    "perl" "/path/to/script.pl"
#      or:
#    "perl" "C:\path\to\script.pl"
# 3. If you are in a UNIX-like environment, perl/python is in PATH, and the
#    script file has executable permissions:
#    "/path/to/script.pl"

# [ARRAY] Dualstrusion post-processing script.
#   See https://github.com/DrLex0/DualstrusionPostproc for more information.

#DUALSTRUDE_SCRIPT = "/Your/path/to/dualstrusion-postproc.pl"

# [ARRAY] PWM postprocessor script, in case you would be using the
#   MightyVariableFan system, my slightly crazy solution to obtain variable
#   fan speed by having the FFCP communicate with a Raspberry Pi through beep
#   sounds. You can pass extra options like "--allow_split" by adding them to
#   the array.
# See https://github.com/DrLex0/MightyVariableFan for more information.

#PWM_SCRIPT = "/Your/path/to/pwm_postprocessor.py" "--allow_split"

# [ARRAY] Path to the (experimental) retraction improver script.
#   It also fixes the under-extrusion when starting to print the skirt.

#RETRACT_SCRIPT = "/Your/path/to/retraction-improver.pl"


### ADVANCED OPTIONS ###
# Only change these if you know what you're doing.

# [SINGLE] The absolutely highest Z value allowed by your printer.
#   This both acts as a sanity check and will also update the final Z move in
#   the end G-code when necessary. (If you would print something 160mm tall,
#   the default move to 150mm must be adjusted to avoid ramming the nozzle
#   into the print.)
# According to official FFCP specs, Z maximum is 150mm, and this limit is
#   hard-coded in older versions of the Sailfish firmware: it will ignore any
#   request to go beyond 150mm. Some newer versions do allow to go beyond
#   this, my printer can easily reach 170mm.
# If you want to get the most out of your machine, do a test to see how deep
#   the bed can go and adjust Z_MAX accordingly, as well as 'Max print height'
#   in all your printer profiles.

Z_MAX = 150

# [SINGLE] For the above to work, this must match the comment string that
#   marks the final Z move in the end G-code.

FINAL_Z_MOVE = "; send Z axis to bottom of machine"

# [SINGLE] Machine type for GPX.
#   Run `gpx -?` and look at the 'MACHINE' section. If it lists 'fcp' as one
#   of the allowed values, it is preferable to use that value here. Otherwise,
#   stick to "r1d", or use something custom if you know what you're doing.

MACHINE = r1d
