**Describe the bug**

Provide a clear and concise description of the bug here.

**Environment**

Include the following things:
* Your OS and the version of PrusaSlicer the issue is encountered with.
  Mind that bugs with alpha releases of PrusaSlicer should probably not be filed. Wait at least until the next beta release.
* The version of your GPX binary (try `gpx -?`)
* The version of your Perl runtime (try `perl --version`), and if Windows, what kind of runtime (Strawberry Perl, Cygwin, or through WSL).

**To Reproduce**

By far the most useful thing you can provide, is a PrusaSlicer project file (3MF) that demonstrates the problem: use “Save Project” in the File menu. If possible, also include both the final .gcode and .x3g files. You can package everything into one ZIP file.

* If specific steps are required to reproduce the behavior, list them here.
