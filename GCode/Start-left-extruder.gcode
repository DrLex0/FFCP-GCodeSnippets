T0; start with the right extruder. We will switch to T1 after having moved the print head to provide enough space for the nozzle offset.
M73 P0; enable show build progress
M140 S[first_layer_bed_temperature]; heat bed up to first layer temperature
M104 S140 T1; preheat nozzle to 140 degrees, this should not cause oozing
M127; disable fan
G21; set units to mm
M320; acceleration enabled for all commands that follow
G162 X Y F8400; home XY axes maximum
G161 Z F1500; roughly home Z axis minimum
G92 X118 Y72.5 Z0 E0 B0; set (rough) reference point (also set E and B to make GPX happy). This will be overridden by the M132 below but ensures correct visualisation in some programs.
G1 Z5 F1500; move the bed down again
G4 P0; Wait for command to finish
G161 Z F100; accurately home Z axis minimum
M132 X Y Z A B; Recall stored home offsets (accurate reference point which you can configure in the printer's LCD menu).
G90; set positioning to absolute
M83; use relative E coordinates
G1 Z20 F1500; move Z to waiting height
G1 X140 Y65 F1500; do a slow small move to allow acceleration to be gently initialised
G1 X70 Y-83 F8400; move to waiting position (front right corner of print bed), also makes room for the tool change
; In theory, Sailfish should combine the T1 with the next move. I have tried to make this work many times and I found it extremely unreliable, therefore I force an explicit tool swap as follows.
G1 F4000; set speed for tool change, keep it low because not accelerated.
T1; switch to the left extruder
G4 P0; flush pipeline
M18 A B; disable extruder steppers while heating
M190 S[first_layer_bed_temperature]; Wait for bed to heat up. Leave extruder at 140C, to avoid cooking the filament.
M104 S[first_layer_temperature] T1; set nozzle heater to first layer temperature
M116; wait for everything to reach target temperature
M17 B; re-enable left extruder stepper
G1 Z0 F1000
G1 X70 Y-74 F4000; chop off any ooze on the front of the bed
G1 Z[first_layer_height] F1500; move to first layer height
G1 X-121 E24 F2000; extrude a line of filament across the front edge of the bed (3mm from the front edge)
; Note how we extrude a little beyond the bed, this produces a tiny loop that makes it easier to remove the extruded strip.
G1 Y-71 F2000
G1 X-108 Y-74 F4000; cross the extruded line to close the loop
G1 X-100 F4000; wipe across the line (X direction)
G1 X-90 Y-79 F6000; Move back for an additional wipe (Y direction)
;G92 E-0.6; This no longer works with relative E. The purpose was to compensate for the inexplicable but consistent under-extrusion that occurs at the start of the skirt. This compensation must now be done in a post-processing script.
G1 F8400; in case Slic3r would not override this, ensure fast travel to first print move
M73 P1 ;@body (notify GPX body has started)
